      "This 1978 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40 was acquired by the seller in 2016 and subsequent refurbishment work involved replacing the body tub, front fenders, and running boards before repainting the truck blue, repairing and refinishing the frame, overhauling the 4.2-liter 2F inline-six, and refreshing the interior. Power is delivered to the rear or all four wheels via a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case, and additional equipment includes power steering and 15″ steel wheels with polished hubcaps as well as a Warn winch, driving lights, Bestop front bucket seats, inward-facing rear jump seats, air conditioning, a RetroSound vintage-look Bluetooth radio, a locking center console, and a rear roll bar with Pioneer speakers. This FJ40 is offered with a car show trophy and a Louisiana title in the seller’s name.",
      "The front doors were repaired and the truck received a replacement tub, body mounts, front fenders, running boards, and rain gutters before it was repainted blue. The front bumper, grille, side mirrors, rear bumperettes, lights, door handles, emblems, glass, and rubber seals were also replaced as part of the refurbishment. Exterior details include a removable hardtop with a white roof as well as a Warn winch, driving lights, and rear ambulance-style doors. A seller-generated spreadsheet documenting parts and labor costs can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels with polished hubcaps are mounted with 33×10.5″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires, and a matching spare is affixed to the swing-away rear carrier. The truck is equipped with Warn manually locking front hubs, an Old Man Emu steering stabilizer, power steering, and power-assisted front disc and rear drum brakes. The brake master cylinder and lines were replaced under current ownership.",
      "The Bestop front bucket seats and inward-facing rear jump seats are trimmed in black vinyl. An air conditioning system and rear heater were installed during the refurbishment along with replacement front seat risers, upper and lower dash pads, door panels, visors, shift knobs and boots, and switches for the wipers, hazards, and turn signals. Black vinyl lines the floor and additional equipment includes a locking center console, a RetroSound vintage-look Bluetooth radio, and a rear roll bar with Pioneer speakers. Blemishes are shown up close in the gallery below.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts aftermarket instrumentation consisting of a 120-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, fuel level, coolant temperature, and voltage. The replacement digital odometer shows 1,800 miles, and the total chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.2-liter 2F inline-six was rebuilt along with the carburetor during the refurbishment and additional work involved replacing the engine mounts, wiring harness, spark plugs, ignition coil and wires, voltage regulator, starter, alternator, water pump, thermostat, radiator, and cooling hoses as well as the fuel tank, pump, sending unit, and lines.",
      "Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The frame was repaired and refinished along with the axles, the transmission was serviced, and the mounts for the transmission and transfer case were replaced along with the exhaust system as part of the refurbishment."

      "This 1970 Plymouth Superbird is one of 1,920 examples produced for a single model year and was purchased by the seller’s father in 2010. An ensuing refurbishment included a repaint in yellow with a black vinyl roof over black vinyl upholstery. Powered by a 440ci V8 paired with a four-speed manual transmission, the car is equipped with a nose cone, pop-up headlights, a rear wing, 15″ Rallye wheels, a Dana 9¾″ rear end with a 3.54:1 final drive, a Hurst pistol-grip shifter, a heater, and a push-button AM radio. This Superbird was inherited by the seller in 2022 and is now offered with refurbishment photos, a production broadcast sheet, removed wheels and tires, and a clean Minnesota title in the seller’s name.",
      "Based on Plymouth’s mid-size Road Runner model, the 1970-only Superbird was designed for NASCAR competition, which required Chrysler to produce approximately 2,000 examples for homologation. This example left the factory finished in Lemon Twist Yellow and was refinished in approximately 2011. Features include an aerodynamic nose cone, flip-up headlights, fender vents, hood pins, black graphics, a black vinyl roof, a tall rear wing, and chrome exhaust outlets that exit below the rear bumper.",
      "The 15″ Rallye wheels wear chrome beauty rings and are mounted with 255/60 Goodyear Eagle GTII white-letter tires. A black-painted spare wheel with an F70-14 Goodyear Polyglas GT tire is mounted in the trunk. Braking is handled by ventilated front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin features high-back bucket seats covered in black vinyl upholstery and white piping and complemented by a color-coordinated dashboard, rear bench, door panels, and carpets. Equipment includes a Hurst pistol-grip shifter, a heater and defroster, Road Runner decals, and a push-button AM radio.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel features a Road Runner horn button and frames a “Tic-Toc-Tach” tachometer with an inset analog clock as well as a 150-mph speedometer, an ammeter, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 32k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 440ci Super Commando V8 features a four-barrel carburetor, a dual-snorkel air-cleaner assembly, and an orange engine block, intake manifold, and valve covers. Output was factory rated at 375 horsepower.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission and a Dana 9.75 inch rear end with a 3.54:1 final drive."
